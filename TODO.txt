For each parameter setting

1, Get graphs of how party support varies with time

1, Get graphs of how opinion mean and variance varies with time

1, test funktion

1, generate testSet: invididuals, partyList AND OTHERS 

Parameters to vary: 

1, mediaEffectScalar - When do we see change from all going towards one party to the case that continues to vary? 

1, transferEffect - (1 both individuals get the same opinion, 0 no change)

2, proportionAffected - When do we see change from all going towards one party to the case that continues to vary?
